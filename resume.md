# Representative Work
#### SDE-2 at Amazon, India May. 2016 - Present
- Developed system to upgrade OS over the air.
- Worked on accessibility initiatives for Amazon lockers. Developed solutions to assist mobility and vision impaired customers.

#### Software Developer at Tuxera Inc, Finland Apr. 2014 - Mar. 2016
- Laid ground work for a new product Tuxera flash friendly filesystem.
- Improved filesystem's block allocator by making it non-serialized resulting in significant performance gains.
- Implemented logic to align writeback to flash boundaries which improved performance of concurrent writes by over 150%.
- Designed automated framework for evaluating filesystem's lifetime on flash memories by defining characteristic workloads and comparing wear statistics dumped from flash device. Results led to subsequent optimization ideas.

#### Senior Software Engineer at Oracle India, Pune July 2013 - Apr. 2014
- Involved in early stage development of a modern highly scalable filesystem based on software transactional memory based concurrency control.
- Worked on improving readahead detection and identifying key statistics to aid performance debugging and add them to the collection framework.

#### Engineer at Netapp India, Bangalore Nov. 2010 - Jun. 2013
- Engineering specialist for performance analysis of modules like Filesystem, RAID, storage within ONTAP operating system.
- Part of 2 member team responsible for performance characterization of file cloning feature of WAFL.
- My responsibilities included studying test scenarios, analysis of bottlenecks (cpu cost, queueing, suspensions, response times and throughput etc.), impact of parameters and client interaction, suggesting improvements to future design.

#### Device Driver Engineer at Qualcomm India July 2009 - Nov. 2010
- Managed the serial and bluetooth host driver subsytem for several SoC targets.
- Was involved in transitioning code to ARMv7 based multicore targets.
- Identified inconsistencies and made crucial fixes targeting newer multi-core ARMv7 processors which introduced new features like speculative readahead, weak memory consistency, lock contention and mutual exclusion.

# Master's Thesis
#### Optimised Load Balancing for Satellite Data Processing May 2008 - May 2009
- Work done in collaboration with Space Application Centre, ISRO
- Workload at ISRO consists of a DAG of independent jobs that handle a large amount of data and are compute intensive.
- Developed a system to transparently distribute jobs to the available computing resources while taking care of requirements of input data.
- Key optimization was overlapping of file transfer time and computation time.
- Modifications allowed us to achieve 1.5-2 times better performance than existing solutions over a usual grid deployment.

# Achievements/Other Activities
- All India Rank 312</B> among 180,000+ students in the IIT JEE, the exam for admission to the IITs.
- Secured all India Rank 230 among about 300,000+ candidates in the AIEEE.
- 1st prize, Electronics competition Leviathon at IIT Kanpur.
